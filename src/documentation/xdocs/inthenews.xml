    <s1 title="POI in the news">
        <p>
                These are articles/etc. posted about POI around the web.  If you
                see POI in the news or mentioned at least somewhat prominently
                on a site (not your homepage that you put the work POI on in
                order to get us to link you and by the why here is a picture of
                your wife in kids) then send a patch to the list.  In general
                equal time will be given so please feel free to send inflamatory
                defamation as well as favorable, technical and factual.  Really
                stupid things won't be mentioned (sorry).

        <p>
            Growing up in Florida, one does not use very much French on a day
            to day basis, and while I know how to say French in French I have
            absolutely no idea how to spell it.  So if you are so inclined and
            have the requisite extended characters on your keyboard, please
            email acoliver at apache dot org the proper spelling for French in
            French.
