        <question>
          Why is reading a simple sheet taking so long?
        </question>
        <answer>
          You've probably enabled logging.  Logging is intended only for
          autopsie style debugging.  Having it enabled will reduce performance
          by a factor of at least 100.  Logging is helpful for understanding
          why POI can't read some file or developing POI itself.  Important
          errors are thrown as exceptions, which means you probably don't need
          logging.

          What is the HSSF "eventmodel"?
        </question>
        <answer>
              The HSSF eventmodel package is a new API for reading XLS files more efficiently.  It does
              require more knowledge on the part of the user, but reduces memory consumption by more than
              tenfold.  It is based on the AWT event model in combination with SAX.  If you need read-only
              access to a given XLS file, this is the best way to do it.

          Why can't read the document I created using Star Office 5.1?
        </question>
        <answer>
              Star Office 5.1 writes some records using the older BIFF standard.  This causes some problems
              with POI which supports only BIFF8.

            Why am I getting an exception each time I attempt to read my spreadsheet?
        </question>
        <answer>
            It's possible your spreadsheet contains a feature that is not currently supported by HSSF.
            For example - spreadsheets containing cells with rich text are not currently supported.

            Does HSSF support protected spreadsheets?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Protecting a spreadsheet encrypts it.  We wont touch encryption because we're not legally educated
            and don't understand the full implications of trying to implement this.  If you wish to have a go
            at this feel free to add it as a plugin module.  We wont be hosting it here however.

            How do you tell if a field contains a date with HSSF?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Excel stores dates as numbers therefore the only way to determine if a cell is
            actually stored as a date is to look at the formatting. There is a helper method
            in HSSFDateUtil (since the 1.7.0-dev release) that checks for this.
            Thanks to Jason Hoffman for providing the solution.

            <source>

                       case HSSFCell.CELL_TYPE_NUMERIC:
                             double d = cell.getNumericCellValue();
                             // test if a date!
                             if (HSSFDateUtil.isCellDateFormatted(cell)) {
                               // format in form of M/D/YY
                               cal.setTime(HSSFDateUtil.getJavaDate(d));
                               cellText =
                                 (String.valueOf(cal.get(Calendar.YEAR))).substring(2);
                               cellText = cal.get(Calendar.MONTH)+1 + "/" +
                                          cal.get(Calendar.DAY_OF_MONTH) + "/" +
                                          cellText;
                             }

        <question>
            I'm trying to stream an XLS file from a servlet and I'm having some trouble.  What's the problem?
        </question>
        <answer>
            <p>
            The problem usually manifests itself as the junk characters being shown on
            screen. The problem persists even though you have set the correct mime type.
            </p>
            <p>
            The short answer is, dont depend on IE to display a binary file type  you an attachment properly if you stream it via a
            servlet. Every minor version of IE has different bugs on this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
            The problem in most versions of IE is that it does not use the mime type on
            the HTTP response to determine the file type; rather it uses the file extension
            on the request. Thus you might want to add a
                <strong>.xls</strong> to your request
            string. For example
                <em>http://yourserver.com/myServelet.xls?param1=xx</em>. This is
            easily accomplished through URL mapping in any servlet container. Sometimes
            a request like
                <em>http://yourserver.com/myServelet?param1=xx&amp;dummy=file.xls</em> is also
            known to work.

            </p>
            <p>
            To guarantee opening the file properly in Excel from IE, write out your file to a
            temporary file under your web root from your servelet. Then send an http response
            to the browser to do a client side redirection to your temp file. (If you do a
            server side redirect using RequestDispatcher, you will have to add .xls to the
            request as mentioned above.)
            </p>
            <p>
            Note also that when you request a document that is opened with an
            external handler, IE sometimes makes two requests to the webserver. So if your
            generating process is heavy, it makes sense to write out to a temporary file, so that multiple
            requests happen for a static file.
            </p>
            <p>
            None of this is particular to Excel. The same problem arises when you try to
            generate any binary file dynamically to an IE client. For example, if you generate
            pdf files using
                <link href="http://xml.apache.org/fop">FOP</link>, you will come across many of the same issues.

        <question>
            I want to set a cell format (Data format of a cell) of a excel sheet as###,###,###.#### or ###,###,###.0000.    Is it possible using POI ?
        </question>
        <answer>
            <p>
                HSSF does not yet support custom data formats, however, it should be a
                reasonably easy facillity to add and we'll gladly accept contributions
                in this area.

                These are the built in formats that it does support:

            How do I add a border around a merged cell?
        </question>
        <answer>
            Add blank cells around where the cells normally would have been and set the borders individually for each cell.
            We will probably enhance HSSF in the future to make this process easier.

            I tried to set cell values and Excel sheet name on my native language, 
            but I failed to do it. :(
        </question>
        <answer>
            By default HSSF uses cell values and sheet names as compressed unicode, 
            so to support localization you should use Unicode. 
            To do it you should set it manually:
            <source>

                //
                // for sheet name
                //
                HSSFWorkbook wb = new HSSFWorkbook();
                HSSFSheet s = wb.createSheet();
                wb.setSheetName( 0, "SomeUnicodeName", HSSFWorkbook.ENCODING_UTF_16 );


                //
                // for cell value
                //
                HSSFRow r = s.createRow( 0 );
                HSSFCell c = r.createCell( (short)0 );
                c.setCellType( HSSFCell.CELL_TYPE_STRING );
                c.setEncoding( HSSFCell.ENCODING_UTF_16 );
                c.setCellValue( "\u0422\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043E\u0432\u0430\u044F" );
