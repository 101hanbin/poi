    What is the HSSF "eventmodel"? 
  </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      The HSSF eventmodel package is a new API for reading XLS files more efficiently.  It does 
      require more knowledge on the part of the user, but reduces memory consumption by more than
      tenfold.  It is based on the AWT event model in combination with SAX.  If you need read-only
      access to a given XLS file, this is the best way to do it.

      Why can't read the document I created using Star Office 5.1?
    </question>
  <answer>
    <p>
      Star Office 5.1 writes some records using the older BIFF standard.  This causes some problems
      with POI which supports only BIFF8.
