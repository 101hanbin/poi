            <title>Overview</title>

            <p>HSSF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the 
            Excel '97(-2007) file format. XSSF is the POI Project's pure 
            Java implementation of the Excel 2007 OOXML (.xlsx) file 
            format.</p>
            <p>HSSF and XSSF provides ways to read spreadsheets create, 
            modify, read and write XLS spreadsheets. They provide:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>low level structures for those with special needs</li>
                <li>an eventmodel api for efficient read-only access</li>
                <li>a full usermodel api for creating, reading and modifying XLS files</li>
            </ul>
            <p>For people converting from pure HSSF usermodel, who wish
              to use the joint SS Usermodel for HSSF and XSSF support, then
              see the <link href="converting.html">ss usermodel converting
              guide</link>.
            </p>
            <p>
        An alternate way of generating a spreadsheet is via the <link href="http://cocoon.apache.org">Cocoon</link> serializer (yet you'll still be using HSSF indirectly). 
         With Cocoon you can serialize any XML datasource (which might be a ESQL page outputting in SQL for instance) by simply 
        applying the stylesheet and designating the serializer.
            </p>
            <p>
        If you're merely reading spreadsheet data, then use the 
        eventmodel api in either the org.apache.poi.hssf.eventusermodel 
        package, or the org.apache.poi.xssf.eventusermodel package, depending
        on your file format.
            </p>
            <p>
        If you're modifying spreadsheet data then use the usermodel api.  You
        can also generate spreadsheets this way.

          <title>Compatibility of POI-generated .xlsx files with MS Office 2008 for Mac SP2</title>
          <p>
            Office 2008 for Mac SP2 version 12.2.0 has a serious bug causing some Open XML files to fail to open. 
            This bug is affecting Open XML files from a variety of sources including the Apache POI project. 
            The Apache POI project adjusted the XSSF module to produce "MS-compatible OOXML" by setting the Application extended property to "Microsoft Excel". This will allow users of future versions of Apache POI to produce OOXML documents that will work with Office 2008 for Mac SP2. 
            Please see <link href="https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=47559">Bugzilla 47559</link> for more information.
          </p>
          <p>
            Users are advised to patch existing .xlsx files by the following code:
          </p>
          <source>
  XSSFWorkbook wb = new XSSFWorkbook(path);

  POIXMLProperties.ExtendedProperties ext = wb.getProperties().getExtendedProperties();
  expProps.getUnderlyingProperties().setApplication("Microsoft Excel");

  FileOutputStream out = new FileOutputStream(path);
  wb.write(out);
  out.close(); 
        </source>  
        <p>To unset the Application property use the following code:</p>
        <source>  
  POIXMLProperties.ExtendedProperties ext = workbook.getProperties().getExtendedProperties();
  expProps.getUnderlyingProperties().unsetApplication();
        </source>  
          <warning>
            This is an effective workaround for a short-term bug which is likely to be removed in future versions of POI, 
            when Microsoft returns to compliance with the standard. The proper value for Apache POI created documents would to be "Apache POI" and not "Microsoft Excel".
