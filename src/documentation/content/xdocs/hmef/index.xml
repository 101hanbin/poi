         <title>Overview</title>

         <p>HMEF is the POI Project's pure Java implementation of the 
            TNEF (Transport Neurtral Encoding Format), aka winmail.dat,
            which is used by Outlook and Exchange in some situations.</p>
          <p>Currently, HMEF provides a low-level, read-only api for 
            accessing core TNEF attributes. Embedded MAPI attributes
            are not yet processed, and attachments are not properly
            handled either.</p>
          <p>HMEF is currently very much a work-in-progress, and we hope
            to add a text extractor and attachment extractor in the not
            too distant future.</p>
			<p>To get a feel for the contents of a file, and to track down
			 where data of interest is stored, HMEF comes with
			 <link href="http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/src/org/apache/poi/hmef/dev/">HMEFDumper</link>
			 to print out the contents of the file.</p>
        <note> 
          This code currently lives the 
          <link href="http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/poi/trunk/src/scratchpad/">scratchpad area</link> 
          of the POI SVN repository. 
          Ensure that you have the scratchpad jar or the scratchpad 
          build area in your classpath before experimenting with this code.
