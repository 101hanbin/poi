	This release allows numeric and string cell values to be written to
	or read from an XLS file as well as reading and writing dates. Also
    in this release is row and column sizing, cell styling (bold,
    italics, borders,etc), and support for built-in data formats.  New
    to this release is an event-based API for reading XLS files.
    It differs greatly from the read/write API
	and is intended for intermediate developers who need a smaller
	memory footprint.  It will also serve as the basis for the HSSF
	Generator.</p>

extensively tested in a high load multi-threaded situation. This
release is not considered to be "golden" as it has new
features that have not been extensively tested, and is an early 2.0
build that could be restructured significantly in the future (not
that there are necessarily plans to do so, just that you're better
off basing your code on 1.0 and sticking with it if you don't need
2.0 stuff bad enough to deal with us pulling the rug out from under

<p align="justify">The high level API (package: org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel)
is what most people should use. Usage is very simple. 
</p>

<p align="justify">Workbooks are created by creating an instance of
org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.HSSFWorkbook. 
</p>

<p align="justify">Sheets are created by calling createSheet() from an existing
instance of HSSFWorkbook, the created sheet is automatically added in
sequence to the workbook. Sheets do not in themselves have a sheet
name (the tab at the bottom); you set
the name associated with a sheet by calling
HSSFWorkbook.setSheetName(sheetindex,"SheetName").</p>

<p align="justify">Rows are created by calling createRow(rowNumber) from an existing
instance of HSSFSheet. Only rows that have cell values should be
added to the sheet. To set the row's height, you just call
setRowHeight(height) on the row object. The height must be given in
twips, or 1/20th of a point. If you prefer, there is also a
setRowHeightInPoints method. 
</p>

<p align="justify">Cells are created by calling createCell(column, type) from an
existing HSSFRow. Only cells that have values should be added to the
row. Cells should have their cell type set to either
HSSFCell.CELL_TYPE_NUMERIC or HSSFCell.CELL_TYPE_STRING depending on
whether they contain a numeric or textual value. Cells must also have
a value set. Set the value by calling setCellValue with either a
String or double as a parameter. Individual cells do not have a
width; you must call setColumnWidth(colindex, width) (use units of
1/256th of a character) on the HSSFSheet object. (You can't do it on
an individual basis in the GUI either).</p>

<p align="justify">Cells are styled with HSSFCellStyle objects which in turn contain
a reference to an HSSFFont object. These are created via the
HSSFWorkbook object by calling createCellStyle() and createFont().
Once you create the object you must set its parameters (colors,
borders, etc). To set a font for an HSSFCellStyle call
setFont(fontobj). 
</p>

<p align="justify">Once you have generated your workbook, you can write it out by
calling write(outputStream) from your instance of Workbook, passing
it an OutputStream (for instance, a FileOutputStream or
ServletOutputStream). You must close the OutputStream yourself. HSSF
does not close it for you. 
</p>

<p align="justify">Here is some example code (excerpted and adapted from
org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.HSSF test class):</p>

<p align="justify">Reading in a file is equally simple. To read in a file, create a
new instance of org.apache.poi.poifs.Filesystem, passing in an open InputStream, such as a FileInputStream
for your XLS, to the constructor. Construct a new instance of
org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.HSSFWorkbook passing the
Filesystem instance to the constructor. From there you have access to
all of the high level model objects through their assessor methods
(workbook.getSheet(sheetNum), sheet.getRow(rownum), etc). 
</p>

<p align="justify">Modifying the file you have read in is simple. You retrieve the
object via an assessor method, remove it via a parent object's remove
method (sheet.removeRow(hssfrow)) and create objects just as you
would if creating a new xls. When you are done modifying cells just
call workbook.write(outputstream) just as you did above.</p>

<p align="justify">An example of this can be seen in

<tr>

<br>


<p align="justify">The event API is brand new.  It is intended for intermediate
developers who are willing to learn a little bit of the low level API
structures.  Its relatively simple to use, but requires a basic
understanding of the parts of an Excel file (or willingness to
learn).  The advantage provided is that you can read an XLS with a
relatively small memory footprint.  
</p>

<p align="justify">To use this API you construct an instance of
org.apache.poi.hssf.eventmodel.HSSFRequest. Register a class you
create that supports the
org.apache.poi.hssf.eventmodel.HSSFListener interface using the
HSSFRequest.addListener(yourlistener, recordsid).  The recordsid
should be a static reference number (such as BOFRecord.sid) contained
in the classes in org.apache.poi.hssf.record.  The trick is you
have to know what these records are.  Alternatively you can call
HSSFRequest.addListenerForAllRecords(mylistener).  In order to learn
about these records you can either read all of the javadoc in the
org.apache.poi.hssf.record package or you can just hack up a
copy of org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.EFHSSF and adapt it to your
needs.  TODO: better documentation on records.</p>

<p align="justify">Once you've registered your listeners in the HSSFRequest object
you can construct an instance of
org.apache.poi.poifs.filesystem.FileSystem (see POIFS howto) and
pass it your XLS file inputstream.  You can either pass this, along
with the request you constructed, to an instance of HSSFEventFactory
via the HSSFEventFactory.processWorkbookEvents(request, Filesystem)
method, or you can get an instance of DocumentInputStream from
Filesystem.createDocumentInputStream("Workbook") and pass
it to HSSFEventFactory.processEvents(request, inputStream).  Once you
make this call, the listeners that you constructed receive calls to
their processRecord(Record) methods with each Record they are
registered to listen for until the file has been completely read.

<p align="justify">The low level API is not much to look at. It consists of lots of
"Records" in the org.apache.poi.hssf.record.* package,
and set of helper classes in org.apache.poi.hssf.model.*. The
record classes are consistent with the low level binary structures
inside a BIFF8 file (which is embedded in a POIFS file system). You
probably need the book: "Microsoft Excel 97 Developer's Kit"
from Microsoft Press in order to understand how these fit together
(out of print but easily obtainable from Amazon's used books). In
order to gain a good understanding of how to use the low level APIs
should view the source in org.apache.poi.hssf.usermodel.* and
the classes in org.apache.poi.hssf.model.*. You should read the
documentation for the POIFS libraries as well.</p>

<p align="justify">The HSSF application is nothing more than a test for the high
level API (and indirectly the low level support). The main body of
its code is repeated above. To run it: 
</p>

<ul>
	
<li>download the poi-alpha build and untar it (tar xvzf
	tarball.tar.gz) 
	</li>
	
<li>set up your classpath as follows:
	<code>export HSSFDIR={wherever you put HSSF's jar files}
export LOG4JDIR={wherever you put LOG4J's jar files}
export CLASSPATH=$CLASSPATH:$HSSFDIR/hssf.jar:$HSSFDIR/poi-poifs.jar:$HSSFDIR/poi-util.jar:$LOG4JDIR/jog4j.jar</code>
	
</li>
<li>type:
	<code>java org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.HSSF ~/myxls.xls write</code>
</li>

</ul>

<p align="justify"></p>

<p align="justify">This should generate a test sheet in your home directory called <code>"myxls.xls"</code>.  </p>

<ul>
	
<li>Type:
	<code>java org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.HSSF ~/input.xls output.xls</code>
    
<p align="justify">
This is the read/write/modify test.  It reads in the spreadsheet, modifies a cell, and writes it back out.
Failing this test is not necessarily a bad thing.  If HSSF tries to modify a non-existant sheet then this will
most likely fail.  No big deal.  </p>

<p align="justify">HSSF now has a logging facility (using
 <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging.html">commons logging</a>)
that will record massive amounts of debugging information. Its mostly
useful to us hssf-developing geeks, but might be useful in tracking
down problems.
</p>

<p align="justify">So Why use commons logging rather than log4j? Well the following discussion from
the jakarta-general mailing list sums it up pretty well.  (Thanks Morgan)
</p>

<p align="justify">
<em>Here's the problem, as I see it.</em>

</p>

<p align="justify">
<em>Suppose Commons component A decides to adopt Log4J, Commons component B
decides to adopt LogKit, and Commons component C adopts JDK1.4 logging.
They will all minimally function with the right jars in the classpath.
However you (the end-user) are left with maintaining configuration for 3
different logging APIs, which is tedious at best.  When you take into
account cool features like variable log levels, Log4J appenders and the
like, you're pretty much guaranteed to swallow up useful configuration
options because sophisticated configurations are too difficult to maintain
over mutiple logging implementations.</em>

</p>

<p align="justify">

<em>Contrarily, if all three Commons components use a logging facade, you can
focus all your configuration efforts on one logging implementation.  Sure,
there is a trade-off; you don't have access to all the features, and the
interface between the facade and the implementation must be maintained.  But
the benefits are not just political; they potentially make the end-users
configuration much easier.</em>

</p>

<p align="justify">
<em>Even if all Commons components used the same logging implementation (Log4J
for example), other projects in Jakarta-land may choose otherwise.  If you
add enough Jakarta projects to your environment, you eventually end up with
the scenario described above.  It's a worthwhile effort to attempt a logging
solution that plays well with the Jakarta community at large.  I think in
many cases the Commons Logging component can fill that role.</em>

</p>

<p align="justify">
Refer to the commons logging package level javadoc for more information concerning how to
<a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging/api/index.html">configure commons logging.</a>

<p align="justify">HSSF has a number of tools useful for developers to debug/develop
stuff using HSSF (and more generally XLS files). We've already
discussed the app for testing HSSF read/write/modify capabilities;
now we'll talk a bit about BiffViewer. Early on in the development of
HSSF, it was decided that knowing what was in a record, what was
wrong with it, etc. was virtually impossible with the available
tools. So we developed BiffViewer. You can find it at
org.apache.poi.hssf.dev.BiffViewer. It performs two basic
functions and a derivative. 
</p>

<p align="justify">The first is "biffview". To do this you run it (assumes
you have everything setup in your classpath and that you know what
you're doing enough to be thinking about this) with an xls file as a
parameter. It will give you a listing of all understood records with
their data and a list of not-yet-understood records with no data
(because it doesn't know how to interpret them). This listing is
useful for several things. First, you can look at the values and SEE
what is wrong in quasi-English. Second, you can send the output to a
file and compare it. 
</p>

<p align="justify">The second function is "big freakin dump", just pass a
file and a second argument matching "bfd" exactly. This
will just make a big hexdump of the file. 
</p>

<p align="justify">Lastly, there is "mixed" mode which does the same as
regular biffview, only it includes hex dumps of certain records
intertwined. To use that just pass a file with a second argument
matching "on" exactly.</p>

<p align="justify">In the next release cycle we'll also have something called a
FormulaViewer. The class is already there, but its not very useful
yet. When it does something, we'll document it.</p>

<p align="justify">This release contains code that supports "internationalization"
or more accurately non-US/UK languages; however, it has not been
tested with the new API changes (please help us with this). We've
shifted focus a bit for this release in recognition of the
international support we've gotten. We're going to focus on western
European languages for our first beta. We're more than happy to
accept help in supporting non-Western European languages if someone
who knows what they're doing in this area is willing to pitch in!
(There is next to no documentation on what is necessary to support
such a move and its really hard to support a language when you don't even
know the alphabet).</p>

<p align="justify">This release of HSSF does not yet support Formulas. I've been
focusing on the requests I've gotten in. That being said, if we get
more user feedback on what is most useful first we'll aim for that.
As a general principal, HSSF's goal is to support HSSF-Serializer
(meaning an emphasis on write). We would like to hear from you! How
are you using HSSF/POIFS? How would you like to use it? What features
are most important first?
